MockHttp for HttpClient
=====================

MockHttp is a testing layer for Microsoft's HttpClient library. It allows stubbed responses to be configured for matched HTTP requests and can be used to test your application's service layer.

## NuGet

    PM> Install-Package RichardSzalay.MockHttp

## How?

MockHttp defines a replacement `HttpMessageHandler`, the engine that drives HttpClient, that provides a fluent configuration API and provides a canned response. The caller (eg. your application's service layer) remains unaware of its presence.

## Usage

```csharp
var mockHttp = new MockHttpMessageHandler();

// Setup a respond for the user api (including a wildcard in the URL)
mockHttp.When("http://localhost/api/user/*")
        .Respond("application/json", "{'name' : 'Test McGee'}"); // Respond with JSON

// Inject the handler or client into your application code
var client = mockHttp.ToHttpClient();

var response = await client.GetAsync("http://localhost/api/user/1234");
// or without async: var response = client.GetAsync("http://localhost/api/user/1234").Result;

var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

// No network connection required
Console.Write(json); // {'name' : 'Test McGee'}
```

### When (Backend Definitions) vs Expect (Request Expectations)

`MockHttpMessageHandler` defines both `When` and `Expect`, which can be used to define responses. They both expose the same fluent API, but each works in a slightly different way.

Using `When` specifies a "Backend Definition". Backend Definitions can be matched against multiple times and in any order, but they won't match if there are any outstanding Request Expectations present (unless `BackendDefinitionBehavior.Always` is specified). If no Request Expectations match, `Fallback` will be used.

Using `Expect` specifies a "Request Expectation". Request Expectations match only once and in the order they were added in. Only once all expectations have been satisfied will Backend Definitions be evaluated. Calling `mockHttp.VerifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` will assert that there are no expectations that have yet to be called. Calling `ResetExpectations` clears the the queue of expectations.

This pattern is heavily inspired by [AngularJS's $httpBackend](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/service/$httpBackend)

### Matchers (With*)

The `With` and `Expect` methods return a `MockedRequest`, which can have additional constraints (called matchers) placed on them before specifying a response with `Respond`.

Passing an HTTP method and URL to `When` or `Expect` is equivalent to applying a Method and Url matcher respectively. The following chart breaks down additional built in matchers and their usage:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| <pre>WithQueryString("key", "value")<br /><br />WithQueryString("key=value&other=value")<br /><br />WithQueryString(new Dictionary&lt;string,string><br />{<br />  { "key", "value" },<br />  { "other", "value" }<br />}<br /></pre> | Matches on one or more querystring values, ignoring additional values |
| <pre>WithExactQueryString("key=value&other=value")<br /><br />WithExactQueryString(new Dictionary&lt;string,string><br />{<br />  { "key", "value" },<br />  { "other", "value" }<br />}<br /></pre> | Matches on one or more querystring values, rejecting additional values |
| <pre>WithFormData("key", "value")<br /><br />WithFormData("key=value&other=value")<br /><br />WithFormData(new Dictionary&lt;string,string><br />{<br />  { "key", "value" },<br />  { "other", "value" }<br />})<br /></pre> | Matches on one or more form data values, ignoring additional values |
| <pre>WithExactFormData("key=value&other=value")<br /><br />WithExactFormData(new Dictionary&lt;string,string><br />{<br />  { "key", "value" },<br />  { "other", "value" }<br />})<br /></pre> | Matches on one or more form data values, rejecting additional values |
| <pre>WithContent("{'name':'McGee'}")</pre> | Matches on the (post) content of the request |
| <pre>WithPartialContent("McGee")</pre> | Matches on the partial (post) content of the request |
| <pre>WithHeaders("Authorization", "Basic abcdef")<br /><br />WithHeaders(@"Authorization: Basic abcdef<br />Accept: application/json")<br /><br />WithHeaders(new Dictionary&lt;string,string><br />{<br />  { "Authorization", "Basic abcdef" },<br />  { "Accept", "application/json" }<br />})<br /></pre> | Matches on one or more HTTP header values |
| <pre>With(request => request.Content.Length > 50)</pre> | Applies custom matcher logic against an HttpRequestMessage |

These methods are chainable, making complex requirements easy to descirbe.

### Verifying Matches

When using Request Expectations via `Expect`, `MockHttpMessageHandler.VerifyNoOutstandingExpectation()` can be used to assert that there are no unmatched requests.

For other use cases, `GetMatchCount` will return the number of times a mocked request (returned by When / Expect) was called. This even works with `Fallback`, so you 
can check how many unmatched requests there were.

```csharp
var mockHttp = new MockHttpMessageHandler();

var request = mockHttp.When("http://localhost/api/user/*")
        .Respond("application/json", "{'name' : 'Test McGee'}");

var client = mockHttp.ToHttpClient();

await client.GetAsync("http://localhost/api/user/1234");
await client.GetAsync("http://localhost/api/user/2345");
await client.GetAsync("http://localhost/api/user/3456");

Console.Write(mockHttp.GetMatchCount(request)); // 3
```

### Match Behavior

Each request is evaluated using the following process:

1. If Request Expectations exist and the request matches the next expectation in the queue, the expectation is used to process the response and is then removed from the queue
2. If no Request Expectations exist, or the handler was constructed with `BackendDefinitionBehavior.Always`, the first matching Backend Definition processes the response
3. `MockHttpMessageHandler.Fallback` handles the request

### Fallback

The `Fallback` property handles all requests that weren't handled by the match behavior. Since it is also a mocked request, any of the `Respond` overloads can be applied.

```
// Unhandled requests should throw an exception
mockHttp.Fallback.Throw(new InvalidOperationException("No matching mock handler"));

// Unhandled requests should be executed against the network
mockHttp.Fallback.Respond(new HttpClient());
```

The default fallback behavior is to return an empty response the status `404 No matching mock handler for "GET http://host/url"`.

### Examples

This example uses Expect to test an OAuth ticket recycle process:

```csharp
// Simulate an expired token
mockHttp.Expect("/users/me")
        .WithQueryString("access_token", "old_token")
        .Respond(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);
    
// Expect the request to refresh the token and supply a new one
mockHttp.Expect("/tokens/refresh")
        .WithFormData("refresh_token", "refresh_token")
        .Respond("application/json", "{'access_token' : 'new_token', 'refresh_token' : 'new_refresh'}");
    
// Expect the original call to be retried with the new token
mockHttp.Expect("/users/me")
        .WithQueryString("access_token", "new_token")
        .Respond("application/json", "{'name' : 'Test McGee'}");
    
var httpClient = mockHttp.ToHttpClient();

var userService = new UserService(httpClient);

var user = await userService.GetUserDetails();

Assert.Equals("Test McGee", user.Name);
mockHttp.VerifyNoOutstandingExpectation();
```
	
## Platform Support
